🔆 Solar Power Prediction Using Machine Learning 🔆

We have developed a robust machine learning–powered system to estimate solar power generation ⚡🔋 based on key environmental and temporal features. The project combines data science, modeling, and a fully functional web application, built to support real-world use cases in energy forecasting and planning.

📊 Input Features Used:
The system uses a rich set of features including:
⇝ 📅 Timestamp (hour, day of year, season)

⇝ 🌡️ Temperature (°C)

⇝ 🌤️ Solar Irradiance (W/m²)

⇝ 💧 Humidity (%)

⇝ 🌬️ Wind Speed (m/s)

⇝ ☁️ Cloud Cover (%)

⇝ 🗺️ Location Data (Latitude, Longitude)

⇝ ⛰️ Altitude, Rainfall, Pressure (optional)

⇝ 🧭 Holiday Flags / Calendar Features


🤖 Modeling Approach:
We experimented with various regression algorithms including:

⇝ 📈 Linear Regression

⇝ 🧮 Lasso & Ridge Regression

⇝ 🌳 Random Forest Regressor (best performing)

The Random Forest model achieved an impressive R² score of 0.99 🎯, indicating excellent accuracy in learning the complex relationships between meteorological variables and solar output.

💻 Web App Development (by us):
To make our model practically usable, we built an elegant Streamlit-based web application 🌐✨ that allows users to:
⇝ 🧾 Input weather & location data manually

⇝ 🔍 Get real-time solar power predictions

⇝ 📊 Visualize predicted power output with interactive plots

⇝ 📍 Explore solar behavior based on temporal or spatial patterns

🌈 The interface follows a soft pastel glass UI aesthetic with a clean, modern layout — prioritizing both usability and visual appeal.

🎯 Use Case & Impact:
This end-to-end system is designed to assist:

⇝ 🔋 Solar plant operators in short-term forecasting

⇝ 🏙️ Urban planners managing renewable infrastructure
⇝ ⚡ Smart grid analysts balancing energy flow

⇝ 🧠 Researchers working on sustainable energy models

By integrating machine learning with an interactive web platform, our project delivers a scalable solution that promotes clean energy adoption, supports data-driven decisions, and demonstrates the power of AI in tackling climate challenges 🌱🌞.
